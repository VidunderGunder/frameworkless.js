# Frameworkless

A barebones ready-to-go fullstack app with a pages router, but without the additives and preservatives of Big Framework‚Ñ¢.

Key features:

- Pages Router
- Web Components
- JSDoc for types
  - No compilation step
  - What you see is what you get
- [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/)
  - Simple and fast JS backend
  - Client and server language parity
  - OpenAPI Swagger support
  - [Lot's of other goodies](https://elysiajs.com/plugins/overview.html)

## Getting Started

```bash
bun i
```

```bash
bun dev
```

## Motivation

This is an experiment for me to get familiar with the basics again, after years of using Big Framework‚Ñ¢. I wanted to see how far I could get with the most basic tools, while avoiding compilation, doing to much on the backend side or solving every problem with bloated JS.

In a way it is a preparation for my future HTMX experiments and the [HATEOAS principle using HTML](https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/). I wanted to feel a barebones project with my own hands, so I better can appreciate HTMX.
